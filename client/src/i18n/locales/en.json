    "description": "Kanguya builders began as general contractor workers in 2010 in Cape Town, South Africa, undertaking small building projects around Cape Town. From 2010-2018, Kanguya builders were known as Trust Builders. Towards the end of 2018, Kanguya builders moved to Zambia where we undertook several building projects and changed our name to Kanguya Builders around Lusaka until 2021. In 2022, we moved back to Cape Town, South Africa where we fully established ourselves as formidable players in the building industry, undertaking small and medium size projects, performing project management roles, rendering outstanding services, and providing commercial engineering solutions to our clients.",
